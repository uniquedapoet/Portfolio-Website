        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p style="margin: 20px">
          This Stock Technical Analysis project was developed to enhance my
          expertise in financial analysis and data visualization. The project
          involves a detailed examination of stock data, followed by the
          creation of interactive dashboards that provide insights into stock
          performance, trends, and technical indicators. Full implementation is
          available in a Notebook on Kaggle.

        <p style="margin: 20px">
        The dataset was sourced from Yahoo Finance and includes various stock attributes such as open, high, low, close, and volume. 
        After cleaning and preprocessing the data for accuracy and consistency, I conducted an exploratory data analysis 
        (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations. I also added many technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, 
        in an effort to prepare the data for the use in a Machine Learning Model.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 20px">
          Throughout this project I was able to learn a lot of new concepts in the financial analysis field,
          such as the importance of technical indicators, how to interpret them, and how to use them to make informed decisions.

              The top chart shows 
              the closing price of the stock, while the bottom chart shows the
              moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator and its
              signal line. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that
              shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stocks price. 
              This chart is color-coded to allow users to easily identify buy and sell signals.

              This chart shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, which
              measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI ranges
              from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or
              oversold conditions in a stock. When the stock price dips below the green line,
              it is considered oversold, and when it rises above the red line, it is considered overbought.
