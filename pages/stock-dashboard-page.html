        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p style="margin: 20px">
          This project presents a machine learning-based stock trading model for
          S&P 500 stocks, utilizing a combination of technical indicators and
          machine learning algorithms. The model is designed to predict stock
          price movements and generate actionable trading signals, adopting a
          conservative trading approach by limiting its trades to one share per
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The focus of this model is to maximize profitability while minimizing
          risk over the long term. Using Yahoo Finance data spanning from 2010
          to the present, the model analyzes historical price data, volume, and
          technical indicators to make informed buy and sell decisions. Tested
          via a stock market simulation, the model demonstrates an average
          return of 23% profit annualized profit.

            This data frame highlights key aspects of the model's performance
            over the past year. It provides a snapshot of how the model manages
            cash, stock holdings, and portfolio value, as well as how it
            responds to market conditions.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cash Management</strong>: The model holds an average cash
              balance of <strong>~$5,954</strong>, indicating that it is modest
              with its investments while still being exposed to the market. This
              approach ensures liquidity, aligning with the model's restriction
              of buying or selling only one share at a time, with one exception:
              if there are five consecutive buy signals, the model purchases
              five shares. This strategy was tested extensively and was shown to
              <strong>maximize profits</strong> without negatively impacting
              potential losses.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Shares Held</strong>: On average, the model holds
              <strong>~40 shares</strong> at any given time. This is a positive
              outcome, as the goal of the model is to maximize the portfolio's
              value rather than accumulate cash. By maintaining a balance
              between investing and preserving liquidity, the model successfully
              builds the userâ€™s portfolio, as intended, by maintaining an active
              presence in the market.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Portfolio Value</strong>: The portfolio maintains an
              average value of <strong>~$10,577</strong>, with a typical
              <strong>~5.7% profit</strong> over the year. This figure indicates
              that the model
              <strong>consistently avoids negative returns</strong>, a promising
              sign for long-term profitability. The portfolio's steady growth,
              combined with its measured risk approach, suggests that the model
              is capable of yielding positive returns even under varying market
              conditions.

            <br />
            <li>
              The <strong>standard deviation</strong> of the portfolio value
              (<strong>$1,491</strong>) reflects modest fluctuations, which is
              expected in a dynamic trading strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>median portfolio value</strong> of
              <strong>$10,063.33</strong> shows that, for most of the year, the
              portfolio hovered slightly above the breakeven point.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>maximum portfolio value</strong> reached
              <strong>$18,802</strong>, which shows the potential upside of the
              strategy, particularly in favorable market conditions.
