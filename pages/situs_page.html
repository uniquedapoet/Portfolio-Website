      <h2>About My Time At Situs</h2>
      <p>
        During the Summer of 2024, I served as a Data Engineer/Analyst intern at SitusAMC in their Denver office.
         In collaboration with another intern, I assisted our team in developing a new data pipeline. My primary
          responsibility was creating a Rust-based parser to translate a specialized internal SQL dialect into 
          standard SQL, which streamlined data processing and reduced manual workloads. Additionally, we partnered 
          with clients to develop a comprehensive loan processing system. This system utilized SQL queries to aggregate 
          data, amortize loans, and generate Standard Monthly Mortgages (SMMs), thereby supporting strategic decision-making
          and enhancing operational efficiency.
