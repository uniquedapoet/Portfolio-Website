        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p style="margin: 20px;">
          This project is a RESTful API that I am developing to deepen my
          understanding of API architecture and hone my skills in backend
          development. The API provides comprehensive data on the Formula 1
          World Championship, including detailed information about drivers,
          circuits, and race results.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 20px;">
          The backend is powered by a PostgreSQL database that I constructed
          using datasets from Kaggle. The API itself is built with Python and
          FastAPI, offering a robust and efficient framework for handling
          requests and managing data. Although the API is still in development
          and not yet deployed, the frontend—developed with React—enables users
          to easily search and retrieve specific information on races, circuits,
          and drivers.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 20px;">
          As the project evolves, I am continuously adding new features and
          refining the user interface to enhance the overall user experience.
          This project has been an excellent opportunity to apply full-stack
          development skills, and I am excited to continue expanding its
          capabilities.
