            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This project is a RESTful API I've been working on to build my skills with them and develop an
                understanding of how to construct one. This API includes
                information about the Formula 1 World Championship, including data about the drivers, circuits and
                specific results. The backend consists of a PostGres database, that
                I created from Kaggle datasets. The API itself is build using python and FastAPI and is not yet hosted
                anywhere. The frontend is build using React and allows users to
                search for specific information about the races, circuits and drivers. The project is still in
                development and I am working on adding more features and improving the user experience.</p>
