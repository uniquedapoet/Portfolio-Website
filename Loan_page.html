        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p style="margin: 20px">
          This Loan Default Model and Exploratory Data Analysis project was
          developed to enhance my expertise in Machine Learning and data
          analysis. The project involves a thorough examination of loan data,
          followed by the creation of a predictive model that assesses the
          likelihood of loan defaults. The complete implementation is available
          in a Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle.

        <p style="margin: 20px">
          The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various loan attributes
          such as loan amount, interest rate, and borrower income. After
          cleaning and preprocessing the data for accuracy and consistency, I
          conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and
          correlations. This analysis included visualizations to illustrate how
          different factors impact the probability of loan default, providing
          valuable insights into borrower behavior.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 20px">
          In building the predictive model, the data was split into training and
          testing sets. Given the class imbalance in the data, I applied the
          SMOTE technique to balance it. Various models, including Logistic
          Regression, Random Forest, and advanced stacking models, were trained
          and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
          F1 score. The final model, a stacking ensemble of XGBoost, CatBoost,
          and LightGBM, with a neural network as the meta-classifier, achieved a
          high F1 score of 0.96, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting
          loan defaults.

              This multi-panel visualization, created using the Altair library,
              and provides an in-depth view of how various borrower
              characteristics, such as age, income ratio, loan amount, and loan
              intent, are distributed across both defaulted and fully paid
              loans.
            </li>
            <li>
              By analyzing these distributions, I was able to identify important
              patterns and trends, which guided the feature engineering and
              model-building process. These insights were crucial in
              understanding the underlying factors contributing to loan
              defaults.

              This is a confusion matrix that illustrates the performance of the
              final model on the test set. The confusion matrix shows the number
              of true positives (bottum left), true negatives (top left), false positives(top right), and false
              negatives (bottum left) predicted by the model.
            </li>
            <li>
              The high number of true positives and true negatives, along with
              the low number of false positives and false negatives, indicate
              that the model is effective in predicting loan defaults and
              non-defaults.

              Dots represent individual loans. Their position on the horizontal
              axis shows whether they increase (right of mid line) or decrease (left of mid line) the
              chance of default.
            </li>
            <li>
              Color indicates the feature's value: blue means low, and red
              means high.
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, a high DTI (debt-to-income ratio) increases the likelihood of default, while a high annual income decreases it.
