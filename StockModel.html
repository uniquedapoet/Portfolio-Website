        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p style="margin: 20px">
          This project is a stock market trading model that when trades sp500 stocks,
          the model uses a combination of technical indicators and machine learning 
          algorithms to predict stock price movements and generate trading signals.
          The model is designed to identify profitable trading opportunities by analyzing
          historical price data, volume, and other market variables. The model is built to trade
          on one stock at a time to maximize profits and minimize risk. After simulating trading on
          a few stocks year to date, the model has shown an average of 12% profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model is built using Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and
          TensorFlow. The model is trained on historical stock price data and uses a combination of
          technical indicators, such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD, to generate trading signals.
          The model is then evaluated on a test set to assess its performance and accuracy.

              This is a snippet of some key factors from the final portfolio value after testing on 9 diffrent stocks
              year to date. The model has shown an average of 12% profit, loosing a maximum of 10% on one stock and gaining
              a maximum of 47% on another stock.

              This shows the models tested to identify the best performing model. The model with the highest
              profits (Specific Model) was chosen to trade on the 9 stocks. This model does however also incure 
              the most risk loosing 10% on one stock. Other models such as XGBoost were able to minimize risk but 
              missed out on potential profits.
